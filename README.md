## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [...slug].astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Defaults/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Partials/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ MasterLayout.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Themes/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ ExampleTheme/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ Partials/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ MasterLayout.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro is setup as Server Side Rendering and look dynamically for content and use Layouts for rendering

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
